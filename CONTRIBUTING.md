# Contributing

Please conform to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Commit, do not mess with version, or history.
   (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
